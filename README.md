**call me *trophy* or *darling*. *paw/it* preferred.**

  
  **BOUNDARIES**
  - c+h is completely fine! i love cuddle so much
  - i'm afk half the time so w2i if you actually want to get a response from me
  - friend requests are ok?? i'd prefer if we interacted at least once though
  - if you sign my straw/ata i will not be afraid to share anything you send unless it's illegal. so don't embarrass yourself
  - UMMM for osc people i ship trife (trophy x knife). just a warning if you int with me and if you don't like it. BLOCK ME!!
  - continuation of the previous bullet, if you think trife is proship then um?? DO RESEARCH. EDUCATE YOURSELF. it is just enemies to lovers trope that are completely fine
  - also please iwec if you ship knifecase, its a big discomfort for me due to jealousy and source attached memories

    **OTHER INFO**
    - sometimes i use a typing quirk (s=zz) and i can stop or provide translation, just don't be rude about it
    - i'm a very friendly person meaning if you have c+h/free interactions listed then i'll most likely int, it can be sudden and feel free to tell me back off at any time
    - i am trophy. a trophy introject so please don't talk to me plurally/fictive-wise and refer to me as my source.
    - i'd also appreciate if you didn't mention shitty things i've done as i am source attached.
    - if you sign my straw i'd appreciate if you send trife, a drawing of me (trophy) or knife!! :3
    - i am a yumeshipper, non-sharing yume with knife BUT IF we are friends/mutuals/oomfs (esp close) i MIGHT, keyword, make exceptions. me and knife have been together for 3 (almost 4) years!
    - I LOVE LOVE LOVE KPOP (not the genre... KPOP stands for knife, pickle, oj, and paper :3)
